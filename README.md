# Overview
This website project is part of my DALI application. The domain is publicly hosted by GitHub at jackmcgary.me (if you want to see it render). Also, give it a few seconds to render (there are a lot of high quality images that might take a bit to load).


Thank you so much for your consideration. My email is jackson.r.mcgary.23@dartmouth.edu. Email me if you need any clarification! Thanks again.


# Description
## What went well
The biggest success of this project was the amount of satisfaction and fun I had creating it. Building something creative from scratch is one of the most fufilling things to me. Although I have had some CSS/HTML experience in the past, I learned a great deal this time when it came to scaling on different screen sizes and implementing more interactive elements. I also loved seeing my photography render so nicely (something I had been toying with for a while). I love when my interests intersect, and I really got the chance to showcase that here. 

## Challenges
The toughest part of this project was getting started (like all creative endeavors!). Letting go of my expectations of immediate perfection was tricky at first, but as I got more into the creative flow, those feelings subsided and I had a great time. Also, keeping efficient and organized code while at the same time still trying to add interesting elements outside my comfort zone was a tricky balance to strike. However, I feel as though I struck a good balance in the end.


## What I learned
From this project (and almost every other project I have ever done), I have learned that the hardest part is to temporarily silence your inner-critic and JUST START. Once the ball gets rolling, being in the zone is one of the best feelings. And you can always bring your inner critic back later for the debugging stages ;)
